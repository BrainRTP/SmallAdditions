# SmallAdditions
 
## Description
SmallAdditions is a plugin, that adds a few features to vanilla Minecraft. Currently, it adds Right-Click harvest crop function, that replants the seed and auto-feed.

## Usage
You can enable and disable both harvest and auto-feed in the config file.

Add the harvest permissions to a group/player (either .crops or separate) and right-click on a crop.

Currently, the only command is:
